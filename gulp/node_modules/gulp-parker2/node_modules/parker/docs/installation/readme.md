## Install Node.JS
Node.JS is a Javascript software platform for use outside of the web browser. It allows tools like Parker to be written in JavaScript and run from the command-line on your computer.

npm is a package manager for Node.JS and is also installed by Node.JS installer packages.

Installer packages for Node.JS can be found at the [Node.JS Website](http://nodejs.org/download/) for many operating systems. Node.JS can also be installed using a range of [package managers](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager).
